# BetterTouchTool Notch Bar Setup

The Notch Bar setup allows you to hide or show specific containers on the Notch Bar.

One important setting is the "Show original status icons" option. This allows you to either show the real macOS status items or hide them to make space for other things.
If you decide to hide the original status icons for some mode, you can still use the "Status Items Widget" to get access to a subset of your items.

By default the original status icons are shown while in Menubar Mode but are hidden in Widget Mode.
