## How to make BetterTouchTool recognize your Mouse Buttons
BetterTouchTool can recognize mouse button presses if the mouse driver generates standard button events. Unfortunately many newer mice don't do this by default.

## Logitech Mice

Starting with BetterTouchTool version 5.777, BetterTouchTool natively supports Logitech Mice (by implementing parts of Logitech's HID++ 2.0 protocol - https://github.com/Logitech/cpg-docs/tree/master/hidpp20)

See [Logitech Support](/docs/normal-mouse/logitech) for details on how to configure your Logitech Mouse with BetterTouchTool.

## Other Mice

If you have installed any driver/software for your mouse, make sure to not assign any actions to the buttons in that software. If this doesn't help try to uninstall the driver/software. If your mouse buttons are still not being recognized afterwards, your mouse is most likely not supported in BTT. Some mice also act as keyboard - you may try if a shortcut is recognized in BTT's keyboard tab when pressing a button.
