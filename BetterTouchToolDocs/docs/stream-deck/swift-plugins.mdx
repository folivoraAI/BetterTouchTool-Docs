# Custom Swift / Objective-C Plugins

BetterTouchTool allows you to add your own custom Swift or Objective-C plugins for the Stream Deck.


## Example: CPU Usage Plugin
As an example I have created a little plugin that shows the current CPU usage. You can download a ready to use version here:
http://folivora.ai/releases/BTTStreamDeckPluginCPUUsage.zip

The code is available here:
https://github.com/folivoraAI/BetterTouchToolPlugins

Plugins are installed at this location: ~/Library/Application Support/BetterTouchTool/Plugins


## Plugin Distribution
macOS only allows to run notarized plugins, thus if you want to share your plugin with others you have to follow the notarization process. It's relatively simple, I have listed the necessary commands here: https://github.com/folivoraAI/BetterTouchToolPlugins#distributing-plugins

If you have any questions about native plugins, please ping me via andreas@folivora.ai.
