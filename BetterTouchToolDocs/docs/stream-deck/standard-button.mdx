## Function

Stream Deck Buttons can be used to trigger any sort of action in BetterTouchTool. In their standard configuration a button press triggers the assigned action sequence as soon as you press the button down.

## Appearance

There are many ways to customize the appearance of Stream Deck buttons in BetterTouchTool:
* Changing the background color
* Using rich text including any color and font combination
* Using all sorts of icons including SF Symbol icons (see https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)

BetterTouchTool integrates a very basic rich text editor that lets you adjust fonts, colors & spacing. For more control you can also use the Apple Text Edit app and then just copy the formatted text into the BTT editor.


### Example: Adjusting Space Between Lines

To adjust the spacing between lines select the "Other..." option from the spacing dropdown:

<img style={{width: '300px'}} src="/media/streamdeck_spacing.png"/><br />

In BTT the "Line height - at most" setting works best to make smaller spacing:

<img style={{width: '300px'}} src="/media/streamdeck_line_height.png"/>


## Advanced Configuration

Stream Deck Buttons do offer various advanced options, see the following examples:
* [Button with different actions for long press and short press](/docs/stream-deck/long-press)
* [Button which repeats its actions while being pressed](/docs/stream-deck/key-repeat)
* [Showing buttons only on specific devices](/docs/stream-deck/specific-devices)
