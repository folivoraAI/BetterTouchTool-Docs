# App Specific Setups

You can have global and app specific items configured for the Stream Deck.

By default BetterTouchTool adds the app-specific items to the ones that are valid for all apps. Because of this you might need to use the display order property or the fixed position feature to place them correctly.

You can also configure BTT to only show the app specific items. To do this, click on the app in the left sidebar and select the "Hide Global Triggers" option:
