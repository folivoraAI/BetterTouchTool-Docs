# Stream Deck Pedal

BetterTouchTool includes support for the Stream Deck Pedal: https://www.elgato.com/de/stream-deck-pedal

Although the pedal does not have a display, BTT treats it like any other Stream Deck device. I recommend to configure the pedal in a separate preset to keep everything clean:

The pedal is good to be combined with these features:
* [Showing / changing buttons while holding other buttons](/docs/stream-deck/hold-to-show)
* [Groups](/docs/stream-deck/groups)
