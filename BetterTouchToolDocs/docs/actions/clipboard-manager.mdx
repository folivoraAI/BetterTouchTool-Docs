# Clipboard Manager

BetterTouchTool integrates a nice little clipboard manager. You can activate it by assigning the predefined action "Show Clipboard/Pasteboard History" to some trigger in BTT.

## Features:
* Tracks your clipboard history and allows you to access everything you copied
* Can preview all kind of copied files, e.g. pdf, videos, office documents, images etc.
* Can show all the different data types copied to your clipboard and show them in different view modes (e.g. Hex, Raw Text, Rendered...)
* Keep favorite snippets forever
* Search through your clipboard history
* Allows to edit text inside of the clipboard manager
* Allows to **annotate & edit screenshots** and other images
    * This makes for a great screenshot tool if you combine it with the standard macOS "Copy picture of selected area to clipboard", which can be configured in System Preferences => Keyboard => Shortcuts => Screenshots
* Allows to paste / save as file
* Comes with a basic set of text transformation functions (e.g. plain text)
* Since version 3.356 you can define [custom JavaScript transformer functions](/docs/actions/text-transformer), this allows you to transform the text before pasting it.
* Only on your computer - no data is synced to any sort of cloud
