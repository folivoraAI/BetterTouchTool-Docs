# Defining Keyboard Shortcuts For Floating Menu Items

By default floating menu's only get keyboard focus when really necessary (e.g. when a textfield is active). This allows them to act as auxillary windows for the active app without interfering with the app's text input.
This makes keyboard support a bit more complicated though.

BetterTouchTool offers two options for defining keyboard shortcuts (or other triggers like gestures) to activate specific floating menu items. Both of these options make use of "Conditional Activation Groups".
