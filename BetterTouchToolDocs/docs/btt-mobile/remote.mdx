## BTT Remote (Legacy, Old!)
BTT Remote is a handy little iOS app which acts as a remote control for your Mac. It is very customizable through BetterTouchTool.

**Note**: If you have purchased BetterTouchTool you can use BTT Remote for free. (It also goes the other way around - if you purchase BTT Remote on iOS you get a free BetterTouchTool license)
