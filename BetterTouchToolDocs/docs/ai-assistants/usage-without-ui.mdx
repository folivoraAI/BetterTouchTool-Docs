# Usage Without Showing UI

There are several ways to run AI tasks without a visible chat window — useful for automations, scheduled reports, background processing, and more.

---

## Option 1: Invisible AI Assistant

The simplest approach is to make an existing AI assistant run invisibly. In your assistant's AI Configuration => Tools & Context, provide your task description in the initial user message text area and activate these options:

* Stop & Close After Processing Initial User Message
* Invisible Operation / Don't Show UI

## Option 2: Run AI Task In Background (Action)

The **"h@llo.ai - Run AI Task In Background"** predefined action lets you execute an AI task silently from any trigger. Unlike the invisible assistant approach, this is a standalone action you can attach to any BTT trigger (keyboard shortcut, gesture, Named Trigger, etc.).

### Configuration

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AI Assistant** | Which h@llo.ai assistant to use for this task |
| **User Message** | The prompt to send. Supports `\{variable\}` substitution for dynamic content. |
| **File Attachment** | None, Capture Screenshot (automatically attaches a screenshot), or Choose File |
| **Show Progress Indicator** | Display a subtle progress indicator during execution |
| **Reuse Existing Conversation** | Maintain conversation context across multiple executions instead of starting fresh |
| **Disabled Skills** | Optionally disable specific skills for this task |

### How It Works

1. The action sends the configured message to the selected AI assistant in the background.
2. The assistant processes the request using its configured tools, context, and model — just like it would in the chat UI.
3. The result is stored in the **`BTTLastAIResult`** variable.
4. You can use `BTTLastAIResult` in subsequent actions (show in HUD, paste, use in scripts, etc.).

### Example Use Cases

- **Summarize clipboard**: Trigger via keyboard shortcut, message = "Summarize: \{clipboard_content\}", then paste the result.
- **Screenshot analysis**: Attach a screenshot automatically and ask the AI to describe what's on screen.
- **Process selected text**: Use `\{selected_text\}` in the message to transform or analyze the current selection.

## Option 3: Scheduled AI Trigger

The **"Scheduled AI Trigger"** is a dedicated trigger type that runs AI tasks on a recurring schedule — no user interaction needed. Find it in the "Automations, Named & Other Triggers" section.

### Schedule Modes

**Simple interval:**
Run the AI task every N seconds. For example, every 3600 seconds (1 hour).

**CRON-like schedule:**
Use CRON-style syntax for precise scheduling. Each field supports:
- `*` — every unit
- `*/5` — every 5 units
- `1,5,10` — specific values
- `1-5` — range of values

| Field | Range | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Hour | 0–23 | `9,17` (9 AM and 5 PM) |
| Minute | 0–59 | `0` (on the hour) |
| Weekday | 0–6 (0 = Sunday) | `1-5` (weekdays only) |
| Day | 1–31 | `*` (every day) |
| Month | 1–12 | `*` (every month) |

### Configuration

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AI Assistant** | Which h@llo.ai assistant to use |
| **Schedule** | Interval in seconds or CRON-like date/time conditions |
| **User Message** | The prompt to send on each execution. Supports `\{variable\}` substitution. |
| **Show Progress Indicator** | Display progress during execution |
| **Reuse Existing Conversation** | Keep conversation context across scheduled runs |

### Example Use Cases

- **Daily briefing**: Schedule at 9:00 AM on weekdays to summarize your calendar and tasks.
- **Periodic monitoring**: Every 30 minutes, check a URL or log file for changes.
- **Automated reports**: At end of day, gather data and generate a summary.

### How It Differs from Time-Based Triggers

Regular time-based triggers can execute any action. The Scheduled AI Trigger is specifically designed for recurring AI tasks — it automatically uses the "Run AI Task In Background" action and provides a streamlined configuration UI for both the schedule and the AI task in one place.
