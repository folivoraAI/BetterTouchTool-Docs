# h@llo.ai - Specialized Sub Agents

Subagents allow you to delegate specific tasks to specialized AI models with different instructions, tools, and configurations. The main chat calls subagents when it needs focused expertise — for example, a code reviewer, a refactoring agent, or an automation specialist.

## Setting Up Subagents

Subagents can be configured in the "Automations, Named & Other Triggers" section:
![Agent](/media/hallo_ai_subagent_config.png)

To make them available in your main assistant, you need to enable them in the "allowed subagents" section in your main assistant configuration:

In case your subagent doesn't show up there, try to open & close your main assistant once.

## Tool Access Modes

Each subagent can use one of three tool access modes, which control how it interacts with BetterTouchTool's tools:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **directOnly** | The subagent calls tools directly (no JavaScript). Best for simple, focused agents that only need a few specific tools. |
| **javascriptOnly** | The subagent generates JavaScript code that calls tools via `run_javascript`. This is the traditional BTT approach and produces reusable code. |
| **mixed** | The subagent can both call tools directly and generate JavaScript. Offers maximum flexibility. |

For `javascriptOnly` mode, only the `run_javascript` tool is registered. For `mixed` mode, `run_javascript` is added alongside the agent's other tools.

## Configuration Options

Each subagent supports the following configuration:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| **System Prompt** | string | (required) | Custom instructions for the subagent |
| **Tools** | set of strings | `[]` | Which tools the subagent can access |
| **Tool Access Mode** | enum | `directOnly` | How the agent accesses tools (see above) |
| **Max Iterations** | integer | 10 (max 50) | Maximum number of tool-call rounds before the agent stops |
| **Max Execution Time** | seconds | 60 | Time limit for the entire subagent execution |
| **Custom Model** | config | (inherited) | Use a different AI model/provider than the parent |
| **Icon** | SF Symbol | `cpu` | Icon shown in the chat UI |
| **Short Description** | string | — | Brief description shown when the agent is listed |
| **Context Configuration** | config | (inherited) | Custom context items for this subagent |

## Inheritance vs Override

Subagents inherit most settings from the parent assistant by default:

- **Model & API**: If no custom model configuration is provided, the subagent uses the parent's API and model.
- **Context**: If no custom context configuration is set, the subagent uses a standard agent context preset (lighter than the full parent context).
- **Tools**: Tools are **not** inherited — you must explicitly configure which tools the subagent can access.
- **System prompt**: Each subagent has its own system prompt. The parent's system prompt is not inherited.

## Activity Tracking

While a subagent is running, its activity is visible in the parent chat:

- **Tool calls**: Each tool the subagent invokes is displayed with its parameters and results.
- **Screenshots**: If the subagent takes screenshots, they appear in the parent chat.
- **Thinking**: If extended thinking is enabled, thinking blocks are visible.
- **Progress**: The parent chat shows a live status of the subagent's execution (iterations, elapsed time).
- **Final result**: When the subagent completes, its final response is displayed in the parent conversation.

This transparency lets you monitor what the subagent is doing without having to wait for it to finish.
