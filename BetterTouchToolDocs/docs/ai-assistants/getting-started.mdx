# h@llo.ai - Getting Started

1. To get started you need to assign the predefined action "h@llo.ai - Show Customizable AI Assistant" to any trigger in BetterTouchTool (e.g. to a keyboard shortcut)
2. Next you need to configure at least one AI API that shall be used. BetterTouchTool does not itself offer any AI services - you need to use an external provider like OpenAI, Anthropic or some local model.
   1. Retrieve an API key from your provider, if you need help have a look here: [Retrieve API Key](/docs/ai-assistants/api-keys)
   2. Select the API type & model and enter the API Key ![API Keys](/media/hallo_ai_api_key_setup.png)
   3. Note: When using gpt-5 models, add these extra parameters - otherwise they'll be too slow: `{"reasoning_effort": "low", "verbosity": "low"}`
   
3. Now you could already launch your AI Assistant, it will immediately be able to answer your questions:

1. To make it more useful, select some of the tools and context options, e.g. make it able to run shell scripts or AppleScripts.

Here is an example assistant that you can import which has a lot of automation permissions - make sure you have a good backup system in place because in theory this assistant can do everything to your system.
