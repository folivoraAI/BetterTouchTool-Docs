# How to get API Keys for h@llo.ai usage

# OpenAI

1. **Create your personal OpenAI account** at https://platform.openai.com.
You will need to verify your email before you can login and retrieve your API key.
2. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys 

3. Click the "Create new secret key" button and create a key with the default options. Make sure to copy that key, you won't be able to view it again later (but you can create as many as you want)

4. Make sure to set a spending limit on https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits.

5. It is recommended to add at least $5 credit to your account to get into the higher API usage Tier (see https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/free-tier-rate-limits)

# Anthropic

2. Click "Get an API key", agree to the terms and then create a new API key. Make sure to copy the key as you won't be able to view it again later.

3. Note: AFAIK Google Gemini doesn't allow to set a spending limit so be careful with that. (Please correct me if I'm wrong - andreas@folivora.ai)
