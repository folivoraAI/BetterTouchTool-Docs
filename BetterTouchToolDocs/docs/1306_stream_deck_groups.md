[Example Preset Direct Link](https://folivora.ai/releases/ExampleStreamDeck.bttpreset)

## Setup

BetterTouchTool allows you to create groups that can contain Stream Deck items. Press the little button on the bottom to create  a new group.

Currently BTT does not support sub-groups. This will be added soon.

## Use one device to open a group on another device

If you configure a group of Stream Deck items you can make it open only on a specific device. To do this, just set the serial number of the device for all of the items in the group. This allows you to have a group button on one Stream Deck Device that opens a group on another device.
