# Logitech Keyboard Support

Starting with BetterTouchTool version 5.805, BetterTouchTool natively supports Logitech Keyboards (by implementing parts of Logitech's HID++ 2.0 protocol - https://github.com/Logitech/cpg-docs/tree/master/hidpp20). This allows BTT to recognize and remap even the special keys on Logitech Keyboards.

**Note** This is supposed to be a full alternative/replacement to the Logitech apps like Logitech Options+ or G-Hub. Actually BTT won't work correctly while any of these apps are installed.

## Setup

Go to the "Keyboard Shortcuts" section in BetterTouchTool and select one of your existing shortcuts. Then click the "Add Logitech Keyboard Configuration" button:

Afterwards select the keyboard and press the apply button:

Now you should be able to record all of the special buttons and assign BTT actions to them:

## Options
There are currently no further options to configure the keyboard. Please request any special keyboard feature you might need on https://community.folivora.ai.
