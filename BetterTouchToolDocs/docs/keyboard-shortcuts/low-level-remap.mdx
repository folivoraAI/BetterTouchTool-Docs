# Low Level Key Remapping

Starting with BTT v4.988 BetterTouchTool allows you to do low level remapping of one key to another.

This will really remap your keys, so the system will think that a specific key is now a different key. This is only for pretty specific scenarios (e.g. if you want to transform right-shift into forward delete or similar).

There are two ways to trigger it:

* The new trigger type "Remap Keyboard Key" in the "Automations, Named & Other Triggers" section
* The predefined action "Remap Keyboard Key (Low Level)"

This example would remap the a key to the b key:

In case you run into any issues you can reset the remappings in the settings:
